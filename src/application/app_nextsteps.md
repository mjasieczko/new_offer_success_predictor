Next steps:
<br> - add functionality to change all paths in one file
<br> - learn to use argparse and possibly use this to make improvements to this project
<br> - write unit tests
<br> - write better implementation of encoding (using iterrows and mean)
<br> - do more visualizations (practice it - what is most important - plotly library)
<br> - try more models
<br> - try more features (incremental approach to whole process)
<br> - try balancing training dataset (SMOTE/ SMOTEEN) by over/undersampling
<br> - try to implement metric (but only to choice the besult result, after training, not during!):
<br>  TN as far from 0.5 (for positive class) as possible (close to 0)
<br>  TP as far from 0.5 (for positive class) as possible (close to 1)
<br>  FP and FN as close to 0.5 as possible
