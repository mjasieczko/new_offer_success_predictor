Hi! be sure to change paths in every used function (at this moment there is 
no added functionality to set this in one place).

Next steps:
<br> - add this functionality
<br> - learn to use argparse and possibly use this to make improvements to this project
<br> - write unit tests
<br> - do more visualizations (practice it - what is most important - plotly library)
<br> - try more models
<br> - try more features (incremental approach to whole process)
<br> - try to implement metric:
<br>  TN as far from 0.5 (for positive class) as possible (close to 0)
<br>  TP as far from 0.5 (for positive class) as possible (close to 1)
<br>  FP and FN as close to 0.5 as possible
